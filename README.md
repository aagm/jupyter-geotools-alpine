# Data Science Notebooks for Reproducible Science

Use this as a template for your data science computing notebooks. You need docker and docker-compose.

Just type `sh jupyter.sh develop` and you will be able to connect to `0.0.0.0:8888`. Also, a small microservice API will be running on `0.0.0.0:8889`, as defined in the `api_notebook.ipynb` notebook.

To be able to connect to ee run in the internal console python -c `import ee; ee.Initialize()` and follow the instructions
